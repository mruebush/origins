Loan Origination and Servicing System that is Modern, Available and Digital.

The system will have a form system based on HTML5 that would be used internally by operations, lead maturation and web. There will not be paper files (but it will produce the proper documentation so there will need to be some sort of content or doc management).
Database should be a source that will make the system always remain up. It should be as simple as possible, so it would be cool to see all javascript through node.js and backbone.js or angular for the front end with data elements shared. Looking using a document based NOSQL database for the backend, not sure if Mongodb or Couchdb or Cassandra or other would be good. Maybe name value pair would work. Need to figure this out. 

This would need to be able to run pricing rules and configure products that would be configurable by users for various parameters like location, credit, and would need to support a human workflow and automated workflow (lights out).

It would also need an integration engine to be able to connect to various vendors for everything from credit pulls to DU to what ever is needed. This should support home, auto, student, consumer lending, card etc.

This should be able to transition to servicing and then continue to handle computing interest and processing payments. It should also support mobile first (Responsive) and have REST API that is extensible.

huha, that is a bit of stuff. What should we begin with?
